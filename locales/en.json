      {
        "question": "When should Palliative care be given to a person who is suffering from a chronic illness?",
        "answer": "Palliative care should ideally begin when the diagnosis of a chronic illness is made. It should go hand in hand with Curative treatment so that the person and the family is better supported. But, as the disease advances, the role of Palliative care increases and that of curative treatment reduces.\nPalliative care does not end with death too, and goes on to provide bereavement support to the family."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who makes up a palliative care team?",
        "answer": "The Palliative care team is led by a Nurse  who is trained in Palliative care. In Primary units whose aim is mainly to provide Basic nursing care and social support, this will be a Community nurse whereas in Secondary units whose aim is Specialised nursing care and Symptom management, this will be a Palliative care trained Staff nurse.\nThe Community Nurse is supported by Doctors who have received basic Palliative care training, who occasionally visit the patients who need a Doctor’s care. The Staff Nurse led team will usually have a Doctor who has specialised training in Palliative care enabling better symptom control. The Doctor might not be present in every Home care, but will be guiding the Nurses whenever needed.\nCommunity volunteers are also an integral part of the Palliative care team."
